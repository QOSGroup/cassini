/*
Package ports provides an adapter management center and enables plug-ins for adapter modules
to enhance extendibility and maintainability.

	This development has only three small goals:
	1. Micro code refactoring - change the original code as little as possible;
	2. Determine the interface - provides an adapter interface (AdapterController)
		to enable plug-ins for adapter modules;
	3. Centralized adapter management - provides a pool interface (Ports)
		to enhance extendibility and maintainability.
